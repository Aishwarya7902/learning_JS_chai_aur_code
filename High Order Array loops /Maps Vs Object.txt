1. both are key value pair.........we can do the same thing with objects..then why maps????????ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­

coz......

1. maps remember order of insertion of keys.

2. In maps key can be anything ...be it object/function/primitive values...whereas in objects....keys can be only string or symbol.

3.Maps do not store duplicates.

4.For of loop in map returns a 2 membered array of [key,value] for each iteration. [for of can't be used with objects]

5.maps are iteratable....objects are not under normal condition.
