/*
In layman's terms, the call function in JavaScript is a way to borrow or use a function from one object in the context of another object.

Imagine you have two objects, ObjectA and ObjectB. ObjectA has a function called myFunction. 
If you want to use myFunction in the context of ObjectB, you can use the call method. 
This means that within the function execution, the this keyword will refer to ObjectB instead of ObjectA.

Here's a simple analogy:

Let's say ObjectA is a chef, and ObjectB is a kitchen helper.
ObjectA knows how to cook a delicious dish (myFunction). Now, if ObjectB wants to cook that dish using ObjectA's expertise,
ObjectB can "call" ObjectA's cooking method with call. This allows ObjectB to use ObjectA's cooking skills in its own context.

In code, it would look something like this:
*/


// ObjectA - the chef
var ObjectA = {
  myFunction: function() {
    console.log("Cooking delicious dish!");
  }
};

// ObjectB - the kitchen helper
var ObjectB = {
  // Using call to borrow ObjectA's myFunction
  useChefSkill: function() {
    ObjectA.myFunction.call(this);
  }
};

// ObjectB using ObjectA's cooking skill
ObjectB.useChefSkill(); // Output: Cooking delicious dish!



// So, in this analogy, call allows ObjectB to utilize the cooking skill (myFunction) of ObjectA in its own kitchen (context).
